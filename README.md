##  **Why**
We all have those days when there are a million things to do, and we don't know how we're going to get it all done. It's easy to become overwhelmed by the vast quantity of tasks that we must do from day to day. Sometimes we have so many balls in the air, that we may even lose track of some loose ends and forget to do important things. When we get too busy, we end up feeling like we are barely able to keep our heads above water. Therefore, we need some to-do lists to help us organize your work everyday.

##  **What**
Very simple web page that allows users to scheduling their everyday tasks. It also allow them do delete and mark whether the task is done or not.
##  **How**
We have divided our project into four phases:
1) We wrote the four functions makeTodo, deleteTodo, markTodo, sortTodo.
2) We did the TTD for these four functions to make sure they work correctly.
3)We edited the dom.js file.
4) We edited the html and css files.
